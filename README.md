# Nebula.Scripts

**Nebula.Scripts** is a collection of PowerShell scripts authored and maintained by [Gioxx](https://github.com/gioxx), designed to automate or simplify common administrative and development tasks.  
These scripts are individually published on the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/) for easy discovery and installation.

### üõ°Ô∏è Intune Remediation Scripts

The [`Intune/Remediations`](Intune/Remediations) folder contains proactive remediation scripts designed for use with **Microsoft Intune**. These include detection and remediation script pairs used to identify and fix configuration issues (but not only issues) on managed Windows devices; for example, removing built-in apps or enforcing specific registry-based policies such as disabling Microsoft 365 Copilot.

Each remediation typically includes:

- `*_Detection.ps1`: Returns compliance status (exit code 0 or 1).
- `*_Remediation.ps1`: Applies the necessary fix if the device is non-compliant.

These scripts are not published to the PowerShell Gallery (because obviously not suitable) and are meant to be downloaded directly from this repository or packaged for deployment in Microsoft Intune.  
Within the detection and remediation scripts you will always be able to find the header within which I will try to include all the basic information to understand the purpose and how to use the _pair of scripts_. Please [open an issue](https://github.com/gioxx/Nebula.Scripts/issues/new) in case something is unclear or completely missing in the scripts.

## üöÄ Getting Started

You can install a script directly from the PowerShell Gallery.  
The example below is based on the `Remove-OldPSModules` script, [available here](Management/Remove-OldPSModules.ps1):

```powershell
Install-Script -Name Remove-OldPSModules -Scope CurrentUser -Force
```

Then run it:

```powershell
Remove-OldPSModules.ps1
```

Make sure your [Execution Policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies) allows script execution.

### üÜï Creating a new script for PowerShell Gallery

Use `New-ScriptFileInfo` to generate a script with the correct metadata header required by the Gallery:

```powershell
New-ScriptFileInfo `
  -Path .\MyScript.ps1 `
  -Version '1.0.0' `
  -Author 'Your Name' `
  -Description 'Describe what this script does.' `
  -LicenseUri 'https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT' `
  -ProjectUri 'hhttps://github.com/<your-repo>' `
  -Tags 'powershell', 'scripts', 'utilities'
```

This will create a `.ps1` file pre-filled with a `#PSScriptInfo` header block. After that, you should manually add:

```powershell
# Requires -Version 7.0

<#
.SYNOPSIS
Brief summary of what the script does.
.DESCRIPTION
More detailed explanation of its purpose and usage.
.EXAMPLE
.\MyScript.ps1
Demonstrates typical usage.
#>
```

üìù Make sure to avoid having both a `.DESCRIPTION` in `#PSScriptInfo` **and** in the help block at the same time, or you'll get a publishing error.
